### Key Features Implementation
- **Menu System**: Toggle between main menu and more info overlay
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at md: and lg:
- **Animation System**: Staggered animations, hover effects, and scroll triggers
- **Image Optimization**: Figma assets properly integrated and responsive
- **Performance**: Optimized build with code splitting and lazy loading

## Build Configuration

### Dependencies
- **React 18.3.1**: Modern React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.8.3**: Type-safe development
- **Vite 7.0.0**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.17**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion 11.0.8**: Production-ready motion library
- **GSAP 3.13.0**: Professional animation toolkit
- **Zustand 4.4.7**: Lightweight state management
- **i18next 23.10.1**: Internationalization framework

### Build Commands
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Production build**: `npm run build`
- **Build output**: `dist/` directory with optimized assets

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Size**: ~355KB JavaScript bundle (gzipped: 112KB)
- **Assets**: ~1.3MB total images optimized from Figma
- **Load Time**: Optimized for fast initial page load
- **Animations**: 60fps smooth animations with hardware acceleration

## Development Notes

### Font Loading
- Google Fonts imported via CSS for design fidelity
- Font loading may show CORS errors in development but works in production
- All fonts properly fallback to system fonts when needed

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Default styling (< 768px)
- **Tablet**: md: breakpoint (≥ 768px)
- **Desktop**: lg: breakpoint (≥ 1024px)
- **Large**: xl: breakpoint (≥ 1280px)

### Animation Performance
- Framer Motion optimized for 60fps performance
- GPU-accelerated transforms and opacity changes
- Scroll-triggered animations with viewport detection
- Hover effects with spring physics

### State Management Strategy
- Minimal global state with Zustand
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Navigation state centrally managed
- Section tracking for scroll navigation

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
- **E-commerce Integration**: Add shopping cart and payment processing
- **CMS Integration**: Dynamic content management for gallery and events
- **User Accounts**: Authentication and personalized experiences
- **Advanced Animations**: More sophisticated GSAP animations
- **Performance**: Image lazy loading and progressive web app features
- **SEO**: Meta tags, structured data, and server-side rendering

### Scalability Considerations
- Component architecture supports easy feature additions
- State management can scale with additional stores
- Translation system ready for multiple languages
- Design system established for consistent expansions

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a professional art printing business website with modern web technologies and pixel-perfect design fidelity.
